The folder contains code for object detection and further lane detection.
These practice tutorials are undertaken for understanding the practical application of these algorithms.

 1. For Object Detection, MaskRCNN and YOLOv3 are used to detect objects in the video.
 2. The different learning steps as detecting objects in pictures, processing video etc are in subsequent files.
 3. For lane detection, opencv based algorithms are used along with MaskRCNN based object detection.
 4. In Lane detection, a Object detector based simple collision avoidance warning system is also coded. The code can be further refined to make more accurate warnings. A tram dashboard video is processed for Collision warning.
